# Text-Translation-using-RNN-and-LSTM-
Problem : Text to text translation 
Approach : Used attention mechanism with teacher forcing for more better results.

To reproduce results:
1. Download the datasets for language translation from this site.
2. Set hyperparameters according to your need and run main.py as python main.py

## Results: 
Following is the results for French to english translation

je ne suis pas si occupe d habitude .
= i m usually not this busy .

vous n y etes pas en securite .
= you re not safe here .

je suis content de mon travail .
= i m satisfied with my work .

tu me fais peur .
= you re scaring me .
